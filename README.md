# Python-and-R-Projects
Python projects ending in .py, R in .pdf. Courses: Elements of Software Design, Data Visualization in R, respectively.

```For all Python files:``` a table of each assignment's instructions can be found here:

Assignments farther down the list are considerably more conceptually involved. Many object-oriented data structures and algorithms are explored and
implemented from scratch.

Each R PDF is self-contained. The pdf shows the question/context and both the code and the visualization.
